/**
 *
 * onAction Webhook â€“ Fires when a user executes an email-based action.
 * See onFollowup.js and onCommand.js for an example of how this magical button
 * can be created. An email-action can be added to any email that Gopher sends.
 *
 * It can also be set as the "replyto" for emails that Gopher sends.
 * This lets you send emails that simply ask for a reply, or that
 * have a dialog with the user. All of that arrives here.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - One-click entry for a CRM without leaving email
 * - Mark a task as completed without leaving email
 * - Easily create a new task
 *
